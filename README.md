# LifeAtDE - API
A Ruby on Rails (API only) application built by students for the students of the Ferrara's Department of Engineering.

## Goal
Build an application that allows, quickly and intuitively, to:
* Look for other students to collaborate with to carry out extra-curricular projects encouraging ideas and knowledge sharing
* Sell and exchange teaching materials
* Create study groups
* Stay informed about the news of the Department
